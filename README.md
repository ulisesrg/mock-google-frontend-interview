This project is my solution for the Mock Google Frontend Interview 
found at Cl√©ment Mihailescu YouTube channel in the following link:

My solution is based on the one that is proposed in the video but
it has my personal approach.

Since the JSON files are being requested locally and not from an
API, this project needs to be run on a server to work.

This is just a basic solution that can be improved in terms of
code formatting, linting, styling, etc.
